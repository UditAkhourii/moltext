Research-driven builder working on agent systems, memory architectures, and coordination bottlenecks in AI-native engineering.

Currently building **Brane** — a shared persistent memory layer for humans and developer agents that captures decisions, context, and operational knowledge so systems remain coherent as velocity scales.

Core focus:
- Agent coordination and failure modes
- Long-term memory for AI workflows
- Knowledge persistence and retrieval
- Developer tooling as cognitive infrastructure

I publish technical thinking, experiments, and system designs on Substack and X.
